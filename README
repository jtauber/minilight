This is a global illumination renderer in Python.

I am taking apart the code and putting it back together mostly to understand
it better and possibly add new features but I have other goals such as:

 - making it more suitable for rendering 3D fractals and the White-Nylander
   8th power "Mandelbulb" in particular
 - removing features and adding them back in incrementally to produce a
   tutorial
 - exploring how to optimize with things like PyPy
