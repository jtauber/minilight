This is a global illumination renderer in Python.

Original C version by Harrion Ainsworth
Original Python port by Juraj Sukop

I am taking apart the code and putting it back together mostly to understand
it better and possibly add new features but I have other goals such as:

 - making it more suitable for rendering 3D fractals and the White-Nylander
   8th power "Mandelbulb" in particular
 - removing features and adding them back in incrementally to produce a
   tutorial
 - exploring how to optimize with things like psyco, numpy, partial C
   implementation, etc.

See branches 'no-spatialindex', 'no-autosave', and 'simple-mainline' for
some simplications. See branch 'use-arrays' for an attempt (currently much
slower than original) to use numpy arrays rather than Vector3f class.
